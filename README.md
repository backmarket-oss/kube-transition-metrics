# kube-transition-metrics

(WIP) Live statistics on pod life-cycle timeline.

## Description

Kubernetes controller emitting JSON logs containing granular statistics of pod
transition durations for pod creation to pod Ready.
Includes image pull statistics as well.

**WORK IN PROGRESS, NOT PRODUCTION READY**

## Getting Started

Youâ€™ll need a Kubernetes cluster to run against.
You can use KIND to get a local cluster for testing, or run against a remote
cluster. Note: The controller will automatically use the current context in
your `~/.kube/config` file (i.e. whatever cluster kubectl cluster-info shows).

```sh
go run .
```

## Available metrics

Read about the available metrics here:
[internal/statistics/README.md](internal/statistics/README.md).

## Debugging

`promhttp` is used to publish some metrics about the internals of the
controller.
These metrics are distinct from the pod life-cycle timeline statistics.

See details about the internal observability here:
[internal/prommetrics/README.md](internal/prommetrics/README.md).

`pprof` is also instrumented through the `/debug/pprof/` endpoints, see
[net/http/pprof](https://pkg.go.dev/net/http/pprof).
