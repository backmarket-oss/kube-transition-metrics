# kube-transition-metrics

(WIP) Live statistics on pod life-cycle timeline.

## Description

Kubernetes controller emitting JSON logs containing granular statistics of pod
transition durations for pod creation to pod Ready.
Includes image pull statistics as well.

**WORK IN PROGRESS, NOT PRODUCTION READY**

## Getting Started

Youâ€™ll need a Kubernetes cluster to run against.
You can use KIND to get a local cluster for testing, or run against a remote
cluster. Note: The controller will automatically use the current context in
your `~/.kube/config` file (i.e. whatever cluster kubectl cluster-info shows).

```sh
go run .
```
