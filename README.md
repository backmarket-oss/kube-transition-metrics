# kube-transition-metrics

(WIP) Live statistics on pod life-cycle timeline.

## Description

Kubernetes controller emitting JSON logs containing granular statistics of pod
transition durations for pod creation to pod Ready.
Includes image pull statistics as well.

**WORK IN PROGRESS, NOT PRODUCTION READY**

## Getting Started

Youâ€™ll need a Kubernetes cluster to run against.
You can use KIND to get a local cluster for testing, or run against a remote
cluster. Note: The controller will automatically use the current context in
your `~/.kube/config` file (i.e. whatever cluster kubectl cluster-info shows).

```sh
go run .
```

See:
[cmd/kube-transition-metrics/README.md](cmd/kube-transition-metrics/README.md)
for more information on usage.

The helm chart in `charts/kube-transition-metrics` can be applied to run this
controller in-cluster.

```sh
helm install \
    --values ./charts/kube-transition-metrics/values.yaml \
    --namespace kube-monitoring \
    kube-transition-metrics ./charts/kube-transition-metrics
```

Reasonable resource requests and limits may be:

```yaml
resources:
  limits:
    cpu: 100m
    memory: 64Mi
  requests:
    cpu: 20m
    memory: 58Mi
```

Annotations to configure DataDog agent to scrape Prometheus/OpenMetrics metrics
are as follows:

```yaml
podAnnotations:
  ad.datadoghq.com/kube-transition-monitoring.checks: |
    {
      "openmetrics": {
        "init_config": {},
        "instances": [{
          "openmetrics_endpoint": "http://%%host%%:8080/metrics",
          "namespace": "kube_transition",
          "metrics": [".*"]
        }]
      }
    }
```

## Hacking

Read the [Architecture](doc/ARCHITECTURE.md) design document for a high-level
overview.

`promhttp` is used to publish some metrics about the internals of the
controller.
These metrics are distinct from the pod life-cycle timeline statistics.

See details about the internal observability here:
[internal/prommetrics/README.md](internal/prommetrics/README.md).

`pprof` is also instrumented through the `/debug/pprof/` endpoints, see
[net/http/pprof](https://pkg.go.dev/net/http/pprof).
